<h1>The Best Movies According to Judith</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time:</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Passion of the Christ</h3>
<p>The movie shows the story of Jesus Christ's arrest, trials and suffering, and his execution by crucifixion. It is a very hard movie to watch, but it's a movie everyone should see at least once.</p>
<h3>The Notebook</h3>
<p>Every girl dream of meeting someone who loves her most and whom she loves the most. The movie is romantic, tragic, and courageous.</p>
<h3>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button</h3>
<p>A very interesting movie showing the beginning and end of life doesn't really matter as much as the middle.</p>
